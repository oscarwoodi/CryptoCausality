# Market Making on Economic Indicators

1. First, each participant will bid  on how tight their market is. 10k wide? 7k wide? 
2. Tightest market wins and assumes the role of market maker.
3. All other participants are market takers and obliged to trade with the market maker.
4. In turn, he will (secretly) give a bid and ask price for the economic indicator.
5. Market takers will then trade with the market maker in one direction or the other. Size is always fixed at £1. 
6. If you buy NFP at 315k, then you get paid £1 if NFP realizes above 315k, and pay £1 if NFP realizes below 315k.
7. Market maker will adjust his market for subsequent trades.
8. When all trades are done, and the economic indicator is released, the market maker will pay or receive money from the market takers.
9. In an ideal world, relatively low uncertainty, the market maker should make money and have a payoff profile like shorting a butterfly with no tail risk.
10. Side betting is perfectly legal. After takers all trade requisite size, the maker can offer in larger size.
