## Main Assignment - Rich/Cheap analysis for Crude Oil Futures. Curve Trades

1. CL1, CL2, ...CLN	Find underlying commodity Future CLH9, CLM4, CUR_GEN_
2. FOR CLH9, CLM4	
3. Find time to maturity for each contract (let's use CUR_)	
4. Find interpolants – and choose 1m, 2m, 3m, etc pointson curve	
	1. Use simple piecewise constant interpolants
	2. Use some other parametric form

5. do PCA for the points on the curve	
6. Find Rich/Cheap Signals for each futures contract	
7. analyse the properties of the r/c signals...is it mean-reverting? 	
8. Is “fair value” zero?	
9. What is the reversion speed?
10. Can we find spread or butterfly trades which are mean-reverting? 

-----
## **Extra credit** - Consider Nelson-Siegel of some other parametric form for the curve
	1  consider r/c signals from the curve
	2. Consider aging of contacts along curve
	3. "Forecast" the CL contract price change from carry/roll and reversion to curve
	4. Consider the curve itself. Does it evolve? Can we forecast it? Maybe using similar methods?
